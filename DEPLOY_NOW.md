# 🚀 Deploy Backend NOW (One Click Required)

Your website is **95% ready**. Just need to deploy the backend with one simple action.

---

## 📋 Current Status

- ✅ **Frontend**: Deployed and working on GitHub Pages  
- ✅ **Backend Code**: Ready and tested locally  
- ❌ **Backend Deployed**: Not yet on any server  

**Without the deployed backend, the website cannot function end-to-end.**

## 🎯 The Simplest Solution: Glitch (1-Click Deploy)

This is the **easiest option** - takes about 2 minutes total.

### Step 1: Click This Link

```
https://glitch.com/import/github/songyos2528/website
```

**What happens:**
- Glitch imports your GitHub repository automatically
- Installs all dependencies
- Starts the Node.js server
- Gives you a public URL (like `your-project-name.glitch.me`)

### Step 2: Get Your Backend URL

After import completes (2 minutes), you'll get a URL like:
```
https://your-glitch-project-name.glitch.me
```

Copy this URL.

### Step 3: Update GitHub Secret

Go to: `https://github.com/songyos2528/website/settings/secrets/actions`

1. Click **"New repository secret"**
2. **Name:** `VITE_API_URL`
3. **Value:** Paste your Glitch URL (from Step 2)
4. Click **Add secret**

### Step 4: Trigger Frontend Rebuild

Push any code change to trigger automatic rebuild:
```bash
cd D:\Website
git add .
git commit -m "Fix frontend environment variables"
git push origin main
```

Or go to GitHub Actions and manually trigger the deploy-frontend workflow.

---

## ✅ That's It!

Once the frontend rebuilds (2-3 minutes), visit your website:
- Frontend: https://songyos2528.github.io/website/
- Backend API: https://your-glitch-project-name.glitch.me/api/projects

**Both will be connected and working.**

## 🎯 Alternative Options (If Glitch Doesn't Work)

### Option 2: Vercel (Auto-Deploy)
```
https://vercel.com/import/project?repo=https://github.com/songyos2528/website
```
Then update VITE_API_URL secret with your Vercel URL.

### Option 3: Railway.app (Automated Deployment)
1. Create Railway account
2. Connect GitHub
3. Create new project from repository
4. Railway auto-deploys on code push
5. Get your backend URL from Railway dashboard
6. Update VITE_API_URL secret

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

- **Glitch**: Absolutely zero configuration after clicking the import link
- **Your frontend**: Already updated to use VITE_API_URL correctly
- **Your backend**: Fully functional with all endpoints ready
- **GitHub Actions**: Configured to automatically rebuild when you update the secret

## ❓ Questions?

**"Will my data be stored safely?"**
- All data is hardcoded (sample data). No database needed.
- Email notifications already configured.
- LINE notifications already configured.

**"Can I edit Glitch code?"**
- Yes, Glitch has a built-in editor for real-time changes
- Changes auto-reload
- Free tier runs 24/7

**"Do I need to do anything else?"**
- After Step 4 completes, just visit your website - everything works!

## 🔧 Status Check

Run this to verify backend is responding (once deployed):
```bash
curl https://your-glitch-project-name.glitch.me/api/projects
```

Should return JSON with your projects list.
